                      :-) GROMACS - gmx mdrun, 2022.2 (-:

Executable:   /usr/local/gromacs/bin/gmx
Data prefix:  /usr/local/gromacs
Working dir:  /home/jguven/projects/idp_md/pulling_nvt
Command line:
  gmx mdrun -deffnm pulling -nb gpu


Back Off! I just backed up pulling.log to ./#pulling.log.6#
Reading file pulling.tpr, VERSION 2022.2 (single precision)
Changing nstlist from 10 to 100, rlist from 1 to 1.16

On host azuma 4 GPUs selected for this run.
Mapping of GPU IDs to the 4 GPU tasks in the 4 ranks on this node:
  PP:0,PP:1,PP:2,PP:3
PP tasks will do (non-perturbed) short-ranged and most bonded interactions on the GPU
PP task will update and constrain coordinates on the CPU
Using 4 MPI threads
Using 5 OpenMP threads per tMPI thread


Back Off! I just backed up pulling_pullx.xvg to ./#pulling_pullx.xvg.6#

Back Off! I just backed up pulling_pullf.xvg to ./#pulling_pullf.xvg.6#

Back Off! I just backed up pulling.trr to ./#pulling.trr.6#

Back Off! I just backed up pulling.edr to ./#pulling.edr.6#

NOTE: DLB will not turn on during the first phase of PME tuning
starting mdrun 'Protein in water'
50000 steps,    100.0 ps.

NOTE: DLB can now turn on, when beneficial
